# NYTogether

NYTogether is a browser extension that lets you collaborate with your friends on
[New York Times crossword puzzles](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) directly 
on the site.

This lets you track your progress and streaks directly using the New York Tiems
interface. If staying on the site is not necessary for you,
[Down for a Cross](https://downforacross.com/) is likely a better option.

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Open the New York Times crossword puzzle page
3. Click the extension icon
4. Set your room name the same as your friend's
5. Click "Join Room"
6. Start solving the puzzle!

If you check "Join automatically", you will automatically join the room when you
open the puzzle page. This is useful if you always solve puzzles with the same
person.

## How does it work?

The extension is built with [Plasmo](https://docs.plasmo.com/). Collaboration
is enabled using peer-to-peer networking with [Trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero)
